# About

This is a simple python script for building YouTube ReVanced Extended and YouTube ReVanced Extended.

I made this for my personal use, but thought I'd share here in case anyone is interested.

The main feature of this builder is that you don't need to download any patches or APKs manually. It automatically downloads and builds using the latest available version of all dependencies

# Requirements

* Google Chrome installed on system
* Azul JDK 17 from here - https://www.azul.com/downloads/
  * I recommend downloading the zip and extracting it somewhere. Just remember where you extracted it and add that path to the `ZULU_JAVA_EXE` variable in the program
* Python installed on system
  * I have only tested with Python 3.11.2
* Below pip libraries installed on system:
    ```
	pip install requests undetected_chromedriver beautifulsoup4
	```
# How to use?

* Double click `Build.py`
