# About

This is a simple python script for building YouTube ReVanced Extended and YouTube Music ReVanced Extended.

On the press of a single button, this script will:

* Download the latest version of `Zulu JDK 17`, `revanced-cli.jar`, `revanced-patches.jar`, `revanced-integrations.apk`, `microg.apk`, `youtube.apk`, `youtube-music.apk`
* Build YouTube ReVanced Extended
* Build YouTube Music ReVanced Extended

I made this for my personal use, but thought I'd share here in case anyone is interested.

The main feature of this builder is that you don't need to download any patches or APKs manually. It automatically downloads and builds using the latest available version of all dependencies

# Requirements

* Python installed on system
  * I have only tested with Python 3.11.2

# How to use?

* Double click `build.py`
